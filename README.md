# Clinical-Trials---NLP-project
This code allows to deep dive into details of clinical trials data by using NLP techinques. Source of data: [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/search?viewType=Table&limit=100&aggFilters=status:com)

## General info <a name="general-info"></a>

<p>Main purpose of this project was to train an MLP model based on available training dataset which could predict the age of people in photos in the testing dataset. Dataset consists of photos in age between 20 and 50. 
The project consists of several steps, including:</p>

* Splitting the training dataset into training and validation sets.
* Creating a generator in a separate class to improve model training based on images.
* Building and training the model.
* Evaluating the model.
